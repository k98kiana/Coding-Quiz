# Coding-Quiz

This project is a coding quiz that is utilizing HTML, CSS and javascript. The question asked in this quiz are very basic/beginner-level questions. All buttons to start the quiz and answer the questions are responsive when clicked on. There are also repsonses that appear when a question is answered right or wrong. When the score is shown at the end of the quiz, there is a box that appears so a user can enter their initials to save their score. However, I was not able to work through getting the function to work. I tried too hard to move the answers to a second HTML file, and I might have had an easier time altering the same file.
